# undysfunctional-mapping-functions
*A pile of JS functions for use in Beat Saber NE maps.*

* These functions assume that you already have code set up for importing and exporting your map, so just put these functions wherever you feel like.
* Comments and other `@params` have been put in to make things easier to use
