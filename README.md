# undysfunctional-mapping-functions
*A pile of JS functions for use in Beat Saber NE maps.*

---

* These functions assume that you already have code set up for importing and exporting your map, so just put these functions wherever you feel like
* Comments and other `@params` have been put in to make things easier to use
* This repository is not meant for just my functions, so if you want to submit your own, DM me at `TheGoodBoi#3330` or submit a pull request
* If you want more functions in the meantime, you can look at some other templates:
    * [Mawntee's](https://github.com/Mawntee/Noodle-Extensions-Template-FIle) (JavaScript)
    * [megamaz's](https://github.com/megamaz/python-noodleExtensions-template) (Python)
    * [thelightdesigner's](https://github.com/thelightdesigner/NoodleTemplate) (C#)
